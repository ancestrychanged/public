# communication across servers
using messagingservice and profilestore, "talk" with servers in your roblox game

in this implementation, the `place_1` communicates with all instances (servers) of `place_2`, and gets the info to display on the screengui

there's too much to write

publish `place_1` as main place

publish `place_2` as subplace for `place_1`
