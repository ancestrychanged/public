# animation source folder

this folder contains the source place for most of my animations that i've made
they're all free to use (don't forget to credit though!)
to view or edit these animations, you will need a compatible animation tool:

- **moon animator 2**  
  - if you do not have moon animator 2 installed, locate the `moonanimator2.rbxmx` file inside this folder; then, install it as a local plugin
- **blender**  
- **roblox animation editor**
